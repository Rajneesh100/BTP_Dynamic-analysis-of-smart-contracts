        Verifies that the address corresponding to `user` has been KYC'd
        Stores the hash of the KYC information on-chain to ensure that the data
        has not been altered off-chain. 
        
        This function will grant access to the address corresponding to `user`
        to interact with restricted contracts that ensure `isVerified()` returns true 
        before allowing for contract interactions to occur.

        To ensure the hash stored on-chain matches the data stored off-chain
        Call `getHash()` on the off-chain data and pass the resulting bytes32 output into `verify()`
        This will ensure small issues like spacing and capitalization are accounted for and will not cause hashes to mismatch

        This function should only be called once the user has passed the KYC Verification Process
        And the operator of this contract is positive the data they provided matches their identity

        This is a dangerous function if misused. Calling verify with a non-zero input for 
        `hashedData` will cause every interacting contract to assume `user` is now KYC Verified. 
        Likewise, calling verify with a zero input for `hashedData` will cause every interacting 
        contract to assume `user` is no longer KYC Verified.

        Ensure the keys which operate this contract are safely kept to prevent manipulation
        Locking contract ownership behind a Multi Signature Wallet owned by Company Executives
        Is the safest way to ensure data is preserved and KYC is enforced.

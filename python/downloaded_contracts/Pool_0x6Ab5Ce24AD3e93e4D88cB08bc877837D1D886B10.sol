Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n * constructor() {\n *     _disableInitializers();\n * }\n * ```\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract Initializable {\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\n     */\n    uint8 private _initialized;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initializing;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\n     */\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

The shareholders of the companies work with them, their addresses are used in the Registry contract as tags that allow obtaining additional legal information (before the purchase of the company by the client). They store legal data (after the purchase of the company by the client). Among other things, the contract is also the owner of the Token and TGE contracts.\r\n    * @dev There can be an unlimited number of such contracts, including for one company owner. The contract can be in three states:\r\n    * 1) the company was created by the administrator, a record of it is stored in the Registry, but the contract has not yet been deployed and does not have an owner (buyer) \r\n    * 2) the contract is deployed, the company has an owner, but there is not yet a successful (softcap primary TGE), in this state its owner has the exclusive right to recreate the TGE in case of their failure (only one TGE can be launched at the same time) \r\n    * 3) the primary TGE ended successfully, softcap is assembled - the company has received the status of DAO.    The owner no longer has any exclusive rights, all the actions of the company are carried out through the creation and execution of propousals after voting. In this status, the contract is also a treasury - it stores the company's values in the form of ETH and/or ERC20 tokens.\r\n    * @dev The \"Pool owner\" status is temporary and is assigned to the address that has successfully purchased a company and in which there has not been a single successful TGE Governance Token. The current owner's address of the company can be obtained by referring to the owner method of the Pool contract. If the isDAO method of the same contract returns \"true\", then this status does not grant any privileges or exclusive rights and has more of a historical and reference nature.\r\n    As long as the pool is not considered a DAO, the address which is having this status can interact with such methods:\r\n    - TGEFactory.sol:createPrimaryTGE(address poolAddress, IToken.TokenInfo memory tokenInfo, ITGE.TGEInfo memory tgeInfo, string memory metadataURI, IGovernanceSettings.NewGovernanceSettings memory governanceSettings_, address[] memory addSecretary, address[] memory addExecutor) - this method allows you to create a Governance Token compatible with ERC20, with a full set of standard settings, launch a primary TGE for it by deploying the corresponding contract, and also fully configure Governance using the NewGovernanceSettings structure and arrays of addSecretary and addExecutor addresses. The rules set for Governance will become relevant immediately after the successful completion of this primary TGE.\r\n    - Pool.sol:transferByOwner(address to, uint256 amount, address unitOfAccount) - this method allows you to withdraw ETH or any ERC20 token from the pool contract to any address specified by the owner\r\n    Moreover, while in this status, the pool owner, who has not yet become a DAO, can create invoices without restrictions using the Invoice:createInvoice(address pool, InvoiceCore memory core) method.\r\n    In case of a primary TGE failure, the company owner continues to use their unique status, which means they can recreate the token, TGE, and set new Governance settings within a single transaction.\r\n    */\r\ncontract Pool is\r\n    Initializable,\r\n    OwnableUpgradeable,\r\n    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,\r\n    PausableUpgradeable,\r\n    GovernorProposals,\r\n    IPool\r\n{\r\n    using EnumerableSetUpgradeable for EnumerableSetUpgradeable.AddressSet;\r\n    using SafeERC20Upgradeable for IERC20Upgradeable;\r\n    using AddressUpgradeable for address;\r\n    using AddressUpgradeable for address payable;\r\n    /// @dev The company's trade mark, label, brand name.

This method could work only if the proposal had an Active, Delayed, or AwaitingExecution state at the time of cancellation.
